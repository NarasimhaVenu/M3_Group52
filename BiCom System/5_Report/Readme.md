# BiCom System
## Description: 
* Bi-com system ,is a system that is designed to remotely lock or unlock the automobiles, RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally,RKE systems implement encryption algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegram.
* The term bi-com, is also called keyless entry or remote central locking, refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity. 
* Widely used in automobiles, an RKS performs the functions of a standard car key without physical contact. When within a few yards of the car, pressing a button on the remote can lock or unlock the doors, and may perform other functions.
## Features:
* A BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system
* Typical BiCom status information transmitted to the keyfob are: 
* Print window status (Blue switch on- All led on at the same time)
* Print alarm status - (Blue switch press two times- All led off at the same time
* Print car battery info â€“ (Blue switch press three times- All led on in clockwise manner)
* Print Door status (Blue switch press four times- All led on in anti-clockwise manner)

## Objective:
* To implement BiCom system
## Requirements:
* High Level Requirements:

|  ID  |  Description  |  Status  |
| ------  | ------  |  ------  |
|  HLR1  |  The system should print window status when blue switch press once  |  Implemented  | 
|  HLR2  |  The system should print alarm status when blue switch press two times  |  Implemented  
|  HLR3  |  The system should print car battery info when blue switch press three times  |  Implemented  
|  HLR4  |  The system should print door status when blue switch press four times  |  Implemented  

* Low Level Requirements:

|  ID  |  Description  |  Function  |
|  ------  |  ------  |  ------  |
|  LLR1  |  Press Blue switch once  |  Print Lock  | 
|  LLR2  |  Press Blue switch twice  |  Print Unlock  |
|  LLR3  |  Press Blue switch thrice  |  Activate/Deactivate Alarm  |

## SWOT Analysis:
* Strenghts: By using the buttons on the remote we can control various functions of the car.

* Weakness: Limited Range 

* Oppurtunities: Can implement more features like knowing the status of the car etc 

* Threats: Need to always carry the Key to lock/unlock the car, if lost may lead to theft.

## 4W's & 1H:
* Who: Can be used by anyone who owns an automobile
* What: This system can be used in Locking or unlocking the cars
* When: Used when person want to use the car
* Where: it can be used when the user is within the frequency range 
* How: By using buttons on the remote.
